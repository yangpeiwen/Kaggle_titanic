# Kaggle_titanic
This is my first attempt to learn from kaggle.  
I refer to this article and use some of the features he proposed.
https://github.com/flamingohue/KaggleTitanic

I used the Model Ensemble, but the effect was not as good as I expected, even worse than the individual model.The score range of the ensembling model is 0.74880-0.77272.
But the best score in the separate model is 0.77990
